    <h3>What is <i>MILK-PET</i> ?</h3>
    <p>
        <b>MILK-PET</b> is a fan site that visually mimics the PET from the MegaMan
        NT Warrior and Battle Network series. We are a fan site that host fan-favorite
        assets such as mods for Open Net Battle. We do not host roms or anything
        illegal.
